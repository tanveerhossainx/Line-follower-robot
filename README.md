The robot is able to automatically detect the obstacles and deviate from its normal path. After it has passed on for a while, it then comes back to the normal path

For this project I will need extra sensors and the main ones are L293D Motor Shield and IR Proximity Sensors (pair).
With the function of following the line I want to add some other extra functions such as to stop in case of an obstacle like it might be in the real world, that is, if you did something like that with trams and instead of rails there was only one coloured line these would need sensors that don't make them collide with each other.
